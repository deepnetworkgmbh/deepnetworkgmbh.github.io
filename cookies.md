                        <h2>Statement on the use of cookies, the analysis of usage data and the use of analysis tools</h2>
                        We use cookies and similar software tools such as HTML5 Storage or Local Shared Objects (together "cookies") to identify your interests and particularly popular areas of our websites and use this information to improve the design of our websites and make them even more user-friendly. For the same purposes we use the analysis tools Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics; cookies may also be used here.
                        <h3>Functions and use of cookies</h3>
                        <ul type="1">  
                            <li>Cookies are small files that are placed on your desktop, notebook or mobile device by a website you visit. From this we can, for example, recognize whether there has already been a connection between your device and our websites, or which language or other settings you prefer. Cookies may also contain personal data.</li>
                            <li>By using our websites, you agree to the use of cookies. You can also visit our website without consenting to the use of cookies. This means that you can refuse such use and delete cookies at any time by making the appropriate settings on your device. This is done as follows:
                                <ul type="a">
                                    <li>Most browsers are pre-set to automatically accept cookies. You can change this setting by activating the setting *do not accept cookies* in your browser.</li>
                                    <li>You can delete existing cookies at any time. You can find out how this works in detail in the instructions of your browser or device manufacturer.</li>
                                    <li>For information on deactivating Local Shared Objects, see the following link: Information on deactivating Local Shared Objects</li>
                                    <li>Like the use of cookies, their rejection or deletion is also linked to the device used and also to the browser used in each case. You must therefore reject or delete the cookies separately for each of your devices and, if you use several browsers, also for each browser.</li>
                                    <li>If you decide against the use of cookies, it is possible that not all functions of our websites are available to you or that individual functions are only available to you to a limited extent.</li>
                                    <li>We categorize cookies as follows:
                                        <ul type="i">
                                            <li>Essential cookies (type 1)<br />
                                            These cookies are absolutely necessary for the functions of the web pages. Without these cookies we would not be able to offer you services such as the vehicle configurator, for example.</li>
                                            <li>Functional cookies (type 2)<br />
                                            These cookies facilitate the operation and improve the functions of the web pages. For example, we store your language settings in functional cookies.</li>
                                            <li>Performance cookies (Type 3)<br />
                                            These cookies collect information about how you use our website. This enables us to identify which parts of our Internet offer are particularly popular and thus improve our offer for you. Please also read the section "Analysis of usage data".</li>
                                            <li>Third-party cookies (type 4)<br />
                                            These cookies are set by third parties, e.g. social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+, whose content you can integrate via the "social plug-ins" offered on our websites. For more information on the use and function of the social plug-ins, please refer to section 4 of our Privacy Statement.</li>
