# Jekyll base for www.deepnetwork.com

## Installation

You need jekyll (and a ruby install)

Run `bundle install`

`git clone git@github.com:deepnetworkgmbh/www.deepnetwork.com-2021.git _site`

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

## Making changes

After you made all the changes you want to the jekyll site, you'll need to push to both this repository
and all changes are being written to the `_site/` directory. Since we cloned into that, you need to push
to that directory as well!!!

After pushing into `www.deepnetwork.com-2021` the changes will go live!
